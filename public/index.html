<h1>Original Warm Fuzzies</h1>

<p dir="ltr">There once was a psychotherapist and writer,
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Steiner">
	Claude Steiner</a>. Among his writings are:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr"><em>The Original Warm Fuzzy Tale</em></li>
<li dir="ltr"><em>Games Alcoholics Play</em></li>
<li dir="ltr"><em>Scripts People Live</em></li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><em>The Original Warm Fuzzy Tale</em> is a short story
	and can be purchased from Amazon but is currently priced at over $30.
	The printed book (all of the text at least) is the same as what can be
	viewed online at
	<a href="http://democracy.mkolar.org/warmfuzzytale/warmfuzzy1.html">
	The Original Warm Fuzzy Tale</a>. The book is classified as a children's
	story but it is highly relevant to <strong>everyone of all ages</strong>.
	It is only 14 small pages and can be read in a few minutes.
	I hope everyone does.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Wow! Thirty dollars! That seems like a Cold Prickly to me.
	Read the story and you will understand why I say that. The first page in
	<a href="http://democracy.mkolar.org/warmfuzzytale/warmfuzzy1.html">
	The Original Warm Fuzzy Tale</a> says the book is available from
	proedinc.com but I cannot find it there.</p>
